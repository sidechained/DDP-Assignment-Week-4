# DDP-Assignment-Week-4: Berlin Bathroom Beacon

This repo contains [code](01_shiny_application) and a [presentation](02_slidify_presentation) for a simple interactive map-based application created in R using Shiny and Leaflet. The app allows users to find public bathroom facilities located within the Berlin municipality.

The results are based on an open data set taken from the the berlin.de website [here](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/standorte-der-Ã¶ffentlichen-toiletten). This data is displayed on a map of Berlin provided by the Open Street Map project.

The published version of the app can be found on shinyapps.io [here](https://sidechained.shinyapps.io/ddp_shiny/).

The published version of the presentation can be found on github pages [here](https://sidechained.github.io/DDP-Assignment-Week-4/02_slidify_presentation/index.html#1)
